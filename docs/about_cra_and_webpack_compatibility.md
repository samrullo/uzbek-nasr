Thanks for the detailed output ‚Äî this confirms that your project was scaffolded with Create React App (CRA), which uses react-scripts. CRA internally pins webpack to version 4.42.0, and your project currently has Webpack 5.99.8 installed, which is incompatible.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Goal

Fix the error by removing the manually installed incompatible Webpack 5 and allowing react-scripts to install the correct version (4.42.0).

‚∏ª

üßπ Fix the issue step by step

From your project root (uzbek-nasr), do the following in exact order:

‚∏ª

1. Delete node_modules and lock file

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json


‚∏ª

2. Remove manually added webpack

If you have webpack listed in package.json under dependencies or devDependencies, delete that line.

Example:

"devDependencies": {
  "webpack": "^5.99.8",  ‚Üê‚ùå delete this
  ...
}

Save the file.

‚∏ª

3. Reinstall dependencies

npm install

Let react-scripts pull in the correct version of Webpack (4.42.0).

‚∏ª

4. Start the project again

npm start


‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT manually install webpack in a CRA project

Unless you eject from CRA (not recommended unless you know exactly why), you must let react-scripts manage its own Webpack and Babel setup.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Optional (Only if still broken)

If the issue still persists, you can add a .env file in the project root with:

SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true

‚Ä¶but this is a temporary workaround and may cause unexpected errors later. Use this only if you‚Äôre stuck and don‚Äôt want to eject or rebuild.

Let me know if you want to fully migrate to a custom Webpack setup or Vite for more flexibility and speed. I can help you convert your CRA app if needed.
